# **Python Data Analysis (PANDAS)** 
## Overview
Welcome to the Python Data Analysis (PANDAS) assignment! If you've ever wondered how data scientists wrangle massive datasets with ease, you're in for a treat. In this assignment, you'll dive deep into the powerful Pandas library, a must-have tool in the world of data analysis and manipulation.
## It's Excel, but Make It... Pythonic!?
Pandas is like Excel’s cool sibling—it can handle data efficiently, whether it's just a few rows or millions of them, but with the full power and flexibility of Python. It makes data handling in Python simple, efficient, and fun because it equips you with intuitive and flexible tools to manipulate, clean, and analyze data. In this assignment, you'll explore how to unlock the full potential of Pandas to turn raw data into actionable insights. Maybe you'll see how Pandas lets you do everything you love (and sometimes hate) about Excel, but in a more streamlined, programmatic way!
## The Basics
This programming assignment covers the basics of data manipulation using the Pandas library. Through Jupyter Notebook, you will learn to:
- Create, load, and inspect datasets.
- Use Pandas data structures such as Series and DataFrames.
- Perform basic data manipulation tasks, including selecting, filtering, and modifying data.
- Understand the essential functions and methods in Pandas that will help you transform raw data into a structured format for analysis.
## Setup
1. Install Jupyter Notebook through [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or directly from their [website](https://jupyter.org)
2. Run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `Aparicio_Pandas-P1` or `Aparicio_Pandas-P2`.
